  "feature_description": "Fix Tasting Item Naming and Navigation Issues Based on User Feedback",
  "problem_statement": "After reviewing the mobile app screenshots more carefully, the main issues are: 1) Items are showing generic names like 'Coffee 1', 'Coffee 2' instead of meaningful names, 2) The item name editing is not clearly discoverable (user specifically mentions needing an 'editable field'), 3) Photo upload button is missing or not visible, and 4) For sessions with many items, there's no 'jump to' feature to quickly navigate to specific items (user mentions being on 'item 100 and wanting to edit item 3').",

    "item_naming_issue": {
      "what_user_sees": "Items display as 'Coffee 1', 'Coffee 2', 'Coffee 3' etc.",

      "current_behavior": "Items get auto-named as '{Category} {Number}' in QuickTastingSession.tsx line 222",
