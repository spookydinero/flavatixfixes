## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user in a quick tasting session, I want a cleaner interface that removes redundant "Mode: Quick" information and allows me to easily change the category of my tasting session directly from the session header, so that I have a more functional and less cluttered experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am viewing a quick tasting session header, **When** I look at the session information, **Then** I should not see "Mode: Quick" displayed since I already know I'm in quick mode
2. **Given** I am viewing a quick tasting session header, **When** I want to change the category, **Then** I should see a dropdown selector instead of static "Category: Coffee" text
3. **Given** I have a category dropdown in the session header, **When** I select a different category, **Then** the session should update to the new category and any existing items should reflect the change
4. **Given** I change the category during a session, **When** I continue with my tasting, **Then** the new category should be maintained throughout the session

### Edge Cases
- What happens when I change category with items that have photos or notes? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should category change preserve item data or require confirmation?]
- How does the system handle category changes when other users are participating in the session? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there multi-user considerations for category changes?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST remove the "Mode: Quick" display from quick tasting session headers
- **FR-002**: System MUST replace static "Category: [category]" text with an editable dropdown selector
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to change the category of their tasting session directly from the session header
- **FR-004**: System MUST update the session category when a user selects a different option from the dropdown
- **FR-005**: System MUST display all available categories in the dropdown selector
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain existing session functionality after removing mode display
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve session data integrity when category is changed
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide visual feedback when category is successfully changed

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Session**: Represents a tasting session with category, mode, and associated items
- **Category**: Represents the type of items being tasted (coffee, tea, wine, etc.)
