# Feature Specification: Enhanced Tasting Summary Display

**Feature Branch**: `001-on-the-summary`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "On the summary it would be cool to be able to see the aroma and flavor inputs as well. Right now it only shows notes. For image 2, that section should be taken out. We don't need it for quick tasting."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user who has completed a quick tasting session, I want to see all the detailed information I entered (aroma, flavor, and notes) in the summary view, so that I can review my complete tasting experience and have a comprehensive record of my impressions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has completed a quick tasting session with items that have aroma, flavor, and notes entered, **When** they view the tasting summary, **Then** they should see all three types of information displayed for each item
2. **Given** a user is viewing a quick tasting session summary, **When** they look at the interface, **Then** they should not see any unnecessary sections that are not relevant to quick tasting mode
3. **Given** a user has items with only some fields filled (e.g., only notes, no aroma), **When** they view the summary, **Then** the system should display only the fields that have content
4. **Given** a user is viewing the tasting summary on mobile, **When** they scroll through the items, **Then** all information should be clearly readable and properly formatted

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an item has no aroma, flavor, or notes entered?
- How does the system handle very long text entries in aroma/flavor fields?
- What if a user has items with different combinations of filled fields (some with all three, some with only one)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display aroma input data in the tasting summary for each item that has aroma information entered
- **FR-002**: System MUST display flavor input data in the tasting summary for each item that has flavor information entered  
- **FR-003**: System MUST continue to display notes in the tasting summary as currently implemented
- **FR-004**: System MUST remove unnecessary sections from quick tasting mode that are not relevant to the quick tasting workflow
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle cases where items have partial information (e.g., only notes, no aroma/flavor) gracefully
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain proper formatting and readability when displaying multiple text fields per item
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure the summary view works correctly on both desktop and mobile devices

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Tasting Item**: Represents an individual item that was tasted, containing aroma, flavor, notes, and rating information
- **Tasting Summary**: The display view that shows all completed tasting items with their associated data
- **Quick Tasting Session**: A simplified tasting mode that should only show relevant information and remove unnecessary sections
