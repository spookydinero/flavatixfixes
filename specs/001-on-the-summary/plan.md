# Implementation Plan: Enhanced Tasting Summary Display

**Branch**: `001-on-the-summary` | **Date**: 2024-12-19 | **Spec**: /specs/001-on-the-summary/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-on-the-summary/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Enhance the tasting summary display to show aroma and flavor inputs alongside notes, and remove unnecessary sections from quick tasting mode. This improves the comprehensive tasting record visibility and streamlines the quick tasting user experience.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 4.9+, React 18+, Next.js 14+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Supabase  
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL (existing quick_tasting_items table)  
**Testing**: Jest, Playwright, React Testing Library  
**Target Platform**: Web application (mobile-first responsive design)  
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend via Supabase)  
**Performance Goals**: <100ms navigation response, optimized database queries  
**Constraints**: Mobile-first design (375x667px target), WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility  
**Scale/Scope**: Single user tasting sessions, moderate data volume  

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### User Experience First ✅
- Mobile-first design maintained
- Clear visual feedback for aroma/flavor display
- Intuitive information hierarchy

### Code Quality Standards ✅
- TypeScript for type safety
- Component-based architecture preserved
- Consistent naming conventions

### Database Integrity ✅
- No schema changes required
- Existing quick_tasting_items table supports aroma/flavor fields
- RLS policies remain intact

### Security Requirements ✅
- No new input validation needed
- Display-only functionality
- Existing authentication preserved

### Testing Standards ✅
- Unit tests for component updates
- Integration tests for summary display
- E2E tests for user workflow

### Documentation Requirements ✅
- Component documentation updates
- User-facing help content if needed

**Structure Decision**: Web application (frontend + backend via Supabase)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Research existing QuickTastingSummary component structure
   - Analyze current data model for aroma/flavor fields
   - Investigate UI patterns for multi-field display
   - Review mobile responsiveness requirements

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research QuickTastingSummary component structure and current display logic"
   Task: "Analyze quick_tasting_items table schema for aroma/flavor field availability"
   Task: "Find best practices for displaying multiple text fields in mobile UI"
   Task: "Review existing UI patterns for conditional field display"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - TastingItem entity with aroma, flavor, notes fields
   - Display logic for conditional field rendering
   - UI state management for expanded/collapsed views

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - No new API endpoints needed (display-only enhancement)
   - Existing quick_tasting_items query remains unchanged
   - Component props interface updates

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Component rendering tests for aroma/flavor display
   - Conditional display logic tests
   - Mobile responsiveness tests

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Complete tasting session with all fields → summary shows all data
   - Partial data entry → summary shows only filled fields
   - Mobile view → proper formatting and readability

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor`
   - Add component enhancement patterns
   - Update recent changes tracking

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Component enhancement tasks for QuickTastingSummary
- UI/UX tasks for aroma/flavor display
- Testing tasks for new functionality
- Mobile responsiveness validation tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Component order: Core display logic before styling
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No violations detected - approach aligns with constitutional principles.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
