## 🔧 DATABASE FIXES APPLIED

### RLS Policies Updated:

**1. tasting_likes Table:**
```sql
-- Dropped restrictive SELECT policy
-- Created new policy allowing public SELECT access
-- Granted SELECT to anon and authenticated roles
```

**2. tasting_comments Table:**
```sql
-- Updated SELECT policy to allow public access
-- Granted SELECT to anon and authenticated roles
```

**3. flavor_descriptors Table:**
```sql
-- Already fixed in previous session
-- Policies allow user access and service role access
```

**4. flavor_wheels Table:**
```sql
-- Already fixed in previous session
-- Policies allow user access and service role access
```

### Code Fixes Applied:

**1. SocialFeedWidget.tsx (Line 76):**
```typescript
// BEFORE (causing 406 errors):
supabase.from('tasting_likes').select('id').eq('tasting_id', tasting.id).eq('user_id', userId).single()

// AFTER (fixed):
supabase.from('tasting_likes').select('id').eq('tasting_id', tasting.id).eq('user_id', userId).maybeSingle()
```

**Rationale:** `.single()` throws 406 error when no rows match. `.maybeSingle()` returns null gracefully.
