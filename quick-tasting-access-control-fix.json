    "title": "Quick Tasting Access Control Fix",
    "description": "Fix access control logic for quick tasting sessions to not require participant roles",
    "problem_statement": "Quick tasting sessions currently try to load participant roles and permissions, but quick tasting doesn't have host/participant concepts. This causes 406/409 errors and unnecessary participant record creation attempts.",
    "business_context": "Quick tasting is designed for solo users to quickly taste items without complex role management. The current implementation incorrectly assumes study mode participant logic applies to quick tasting.",
    "user_story": "As a solo taster, I want to create and complete quick tasting sessions without participant role errors, so that I can focus on tasting without technical issues.",
    "functional_requirements": [
      "Quick tasting sessions should not attempt to load participant roles",
      "Quick tasting sessions should only require creator ownership for access",
      "No participant records should be created for quick tasting sessions",
      "Role-based permissions should not apply to quick tasting",
      "Access control should be simplified to just check if user is the session creator"
    ],
    "non_functional_requirements": [
      "No performance impact on study mode sessions",
      "Backward compatibility maintained for existing quick tasting sessions",
      "Clean error handling without confusing role-related messages",
      "Simplified codebase by removing unnecessary role logic from quick tasting"
    ],
    "acceptance_criteria": [
      "Quick tasting sessions load without participant role errors",
      "No 406/409 errors in console for quick tasting",
      "Access control works based on creator ownership only",
      "Study mode functionality remains unchanged",
      "Clean console logs without role-related error messages"
    ],
    "technical_constraints": [
      "Must maintain study mode participant functionality",
      "Cannot break existing database schema",
      "Must work with current authentication system",
      "Should not affect performance of other tasting modes"

    "edge_cases": [
      "User tries to access quick tasting session they didn't create",
      "Quick tasting session gets converted to study mode",
      "Multiple users try to access same quick tasting session",
