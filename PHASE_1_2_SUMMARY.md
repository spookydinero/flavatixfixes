**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE AND TESTED
**Developer**: Claude AI Agent
**Server**: http://localhost:3000 (Running)

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

Based on Laurence's feedback dated October 2, 2025, I've completed ALL Phase 1 (Quick Wins) and Phase 2 (Navigation Restructure) changes.

---

## ✅ PHASE 1: QUICK WINS

### A) Landing Page Updates ✅

**File**: `pages/index.tsx`

| Element | Old Value | New Value | Status |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Browser Title | "Taste the World, One Sip at a Time" | "The one place for all your tasting needs" | ✅ |
| Meta Description | "coffee and drinks" | "anything with flavor or aroma" | ✅ |
| Hero Tagline | "Taste the World, One Sip at a Time" | "The one place for all your tasting needs" | ✅ |
| Hero Subtitle | "coffee and drinks" | "anything with flavor or aroma" | ✅ |
| Feature Card 1 Title | "Quick Tasting" | "Tasting Notes" | ✅ |
| Feature Card 1 Desc | "On-the-fly solo tastings..." | "On-the-fly tasting note storage and analysis" | ✅ |
| Footer Text | "Taste the World..." | "The one place for all your tasting needs" | ✅ |

**Verified**: ✅ Confirmed via curl - all changes visible in HTML

---

### B) Auth Page Branding ✅

**File**: `components/auth/AuthSection.tsx`

| Element | Old Value | New Value | Status |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Page Header | "Flavatix México" | "Flavatix" | ✅ |
| Subtitle | "México's finest beverages" | "The one place for all your tasting needs" | ✅ |
| Google OAuth Button | Present | Present ✅ | ✅ |
| Apple OAuth Button | Present | Present ✅ | ✅ |

**Note**: OAuth buttons are functional, but require Supabase backend configuration

---

### C) Review Section Fixes ✅

**Problem**: Users couldn't scroll to bottom buttons; navigation bar covered them

**Files Modified**:
- `pages/review/create.tsx` - Line 133
- `pages/review/prose.tsx` - Line 183

**Solution**: Added `pb-24` (96px bottom padding) to main content area

**Result**:
- ✅ Can scroll to bottom of forms
- ✅ All three buttons accessible ("Done", "Save for Later", "New Review")
- ✅ No overlap with fixed bottom navigation
- ✅ Proper spacing for mobile and desktop

---

## ✅ PHASE 2: NAVIGATION RESTRUCTURE

### Navigation Changes ✅

**Goal**: Reduce from 5 tabs to 4 tabs, remove "Social", add "Taste"

**Old Navigation** (5 tabs):
1. Home
2. Create ❌
3. Review
4. Social ❌
5. Flavor Wheels

**New Navigation** (4 tabs):
1. Home ✅
2. Taste ✅ (NEW)
3. Review ✅
4. Wheels ✅

---

### Files Updated (7 files) ✅

| `pages/taste.tsx` | Taste | ✅ (NEW) |
| `pages/quick-tasting.tsx` | Taste | ✅ |
| `pages/create-tasting.tsx` | Taste | ✅ |

| `pages/review/create.tsx` | Review | ✅ |
| `pages/review/prose.tsx` | Review | ✅ |

- ❌ Removed "Create" tab (add_circle icon)
- ✅ Added "Taste" tab (restaurant icon)
- ✅ Updated icon: `donut_large` → `donut_small`

**Features**:
