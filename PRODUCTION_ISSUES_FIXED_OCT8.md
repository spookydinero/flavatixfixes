## ✅ ISSUES FIXED

### Issue #9: Quick Tasting - Fields Not Disabled After Adding Items
**Problem:** Session name and category fields remained editable after clicking "Add Item", causing potential confusion.

**Root Cause:** No logic to disable these fields based on the number of items.

**Fix Applied:**
1. **QuickTastingSession.tsx** (lines 567-594):
   - Added conditional styling to disable session name editing when `items.length > 1`
   - Changed cursor to `cursor-not-allowed` and added opacity
   - Removed Edit icon when disabled
   - Added tooltip: "Cannot edit session name after adding items"

2. **CategoryDropdown.tsx**:
   - Added `disabled` prop to interface
   - Updated select element to respect `disabled` prop
   - Added tooltip: "Cannot change category after adding items"

3. **QuickTastingSession.tsx** (line 620):
   - Passed `disabled={items.length > 1}` to CategoryDropdown

**Result:** ✅ Session name and category are now locked after adding the second item.

### Issue #10: Review Save Fails with Database Constraint Error
**Problem:** Clicking "Save for Later" on review page resulted in error:
```
Error: new row for relation "quick_reviews" violates check constraint "quick_reviews_acidity_score_check"
```

**Root Cause:** Database constraints require scores to be between 1-100, but form was sending 0 for unrated fields. Constraints:
- `acidity_score_check`: score >= 1 AND score <= 100
- `aroma_intensity_check`: score >= 1 AND score <= 100
- `salt_score_check`: score >= 1 AND score <= 100
- `sweetness_score_check`: score >= 1 AND score <= 100
- `umami_score_check`: score >= 1 AND score <= 100
- `spiciness_score_check`: score >= 1 AND score <= 100
- `flavor_intensity_check`: score >= 1 AND score <= 100
- `typicity_score_check`: score >= 1 AND score <= 100
- `complexity_score_check`: score >= 1 AND score <= 100
- `overall_score_check`: score >= 1 AND score <= 100

**Fix Applied:**
**pages/review/create.tsx** (lines 56-95):
- Added `|| null` to all score fields in the insert statement
- Converts 0 values to null before database insertion
- Added comment explaining the fix

**Result:** ✅ Reviews can now be saved with unrated fields (null instead of 0).

### Issue #7: My Tastings - Content Hidden by Bottom Navigation
**Problem:** Last tasting cards in the list were partially hidden by the bottom navigation bar.

**Root Cause:** Insufficient padding-bottom on the page container.

**Fix Applied:**
**pages/my-tastings.tsx** (line 89):
- Changed `pb-20` to `pb-32` (increased from 5rem to 8rem)
- Provides adequate space for bottom navigation (typically 4rem height)

**Result:** ✅ All tasting cards are now fully visible with proper spacing.

## ❌ ISSUES NOT PRESENT (Working Correctly)

### Issue #1: Competition Mode Inaccessible
**Status:** ✅ **NOT AN ISSUE**
- Competition Mode button works correctly
- Clicking switches to competition mode
- Competition settings appear
- "Add Item" button is functional

### Issue #2: Category Dropdown Missing
**Status:** ✅ **NOT AN ISSUE**
- Category dropdown is present and functional
- Displays all categories (Coffee, Tea, Wine, Spirits, Beer, Chocolate)
- Updates session name when category changes

### Issue #8: Tasting Name Lost When Changing Category
**Status:** ✅ **NOT AN ISSUE**
- Tested: Set custom name "My Custom Coffee Tasting"
- Changed category from Coffee to Wine
- Custom name was preserved
- Only the item descriptions updated to reflect new category

## 🔍 ADDITIONAL ISSUES CONFIRMED

### Issue #3: "Add Category" Button Positioning
**Status:** ✅ **CONFIRMED - UX IMPROVEMENT NEEDED**
**Location:** `/taste/create/study/new` page
**Current Behavior:** "Add Category" button is positioned at the top-right of the Categories section header
**Expected Behavior:** Button should be moved to the bottom of the form for better UX flow
**Screenshot:** study-mode-add-category-button.png
**Priority:** Low (UX improvement, not a bug)

### Issue #4: Slider Scale Maximum Value Issue
**Status:** ✅ **NOT AN ISSUE - WORKING CORRECTLY**
**Location:** Study Mode category creation form
**Test Performed:**
- Clicked on "Scale Maximum (5-100)" spinbutton
- Changed value from 100 to 5
- Value updated successfully
**Result:** Scale maximum can be changed without any issues

### Issue #5: "Include in Ranking" Should Be Automatic
**Status:** ❌ **CONFIRMED - NEEDS FIX**
**Location:** Study Mode category creation form
**Current Behavior:**
- "Include in ranking summary" checkbox is unchecked by default
- Remains unchecked even when "Scale Input" is enabled
**Expected Behavior:**
- When "Scale Input" checkbox is checked, "Include in ranking summary" should automatically be checked
- This makes sense because scale inputs are quantitative and suitable for ranking
**Fix Needed:** Add onChange handler to auto-check ranking when scale input is enabled

### Issue #6: 404 Error Creating Study Mode Tasting
**Status:** ❌ **CONFIRMED - CRITICAL BUG**
**Location:** Study Mode creation flow
**Test Performed:**
1. Navigated to `/taste/create/study/new`
2. Filled in: Tasting Name = "Test Study Tasting", Base Category = "Coffee"
3. Added category: Name = "Aroma", Scale Input enabled, Scale Max = 5
4. Clicked "Create & Start" button
**Error:**
```
Error: Failed to lookup route: /taste/study/ffa3533e-9bba-4d45-b0ee-bef6fd2e3184
404: This page could not be found
```
**Root Cause:**
- Study tasting is created successfully in database (has ID: ffa3533e-9bba-4d45-b0ee-bef6fd2e3184)
- Page tries to navigate to `/taste/study/[id]`
- This route doesn't exist (404 error)
**Fix Needed:**
- Create the missing page: `pages/taste/study/[id].tsx`
- OR redirect to existing quick-tasting page with study mode support
- Check if QuickTastingSession component already supports study mode
