  "problem_statement": "Based on user feedback from the mobile app screenshots, the current tasting item experience needs significant improvements in three key areas: 1) Item naming defaults are not intuitive (showing 'Coffee 1', 'Coffee 2' instead of meaningful names), 2) Item name editing is not clearly discoverable, and 3) Photo upload functionality is missing or not prominent enough in the tasting flow.",
